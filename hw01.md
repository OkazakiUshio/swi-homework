2.Computer Science：Computer science is the study of the theory, experimentation, and engineering that form the basis for the design and use of computers.   
计算机科学是对构成计算机设计和使用基础的理论、实验和工程的研究。

3.Software:Computer software, or simply software, is a collection of data or computer instructions that tell the computer how to work, in contrast to the physical hardware from which the system is built, that actually performs the work.

5.Alan Turing: Alan Mathison Turing  was an English computer scientist, mathematician, logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher, and theoretical biologist.Turing was highly influential in the development of theoretical computer science, providing a formalisation of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing machine, which can be considered a model of a general purpose computer. Turing is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence.
